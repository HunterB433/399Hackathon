# My Fullstack App - Frontend

This is the frontend part of the My Fullstack App project, built using React. Below are the instructions for setting up and running the frontend application.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-fullstack-app/frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   To start the development server, use:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the React application and open it in your default web browser.
